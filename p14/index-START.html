    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let p1 = "Amine";
    let p2 = p1;
    p2 = "Saad";

    console.log(p1, p2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const secPlayers = [...players];
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    secPlayers[0] = "Soud";

    console.log(secPlayers[0], players[0]);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const secPerson = {...person};

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    secPerson.name = "Amine";

    console.log(secPerson.name, person.name)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
